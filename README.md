# Feel-Safe
# A Women Safety Application


FeelSafe is an Android-based mobile application designed to enhance women’s safety by enabling quick and discreet emergency alerts. The app empowers users to instantly notify their guardians or emergency contacts during unsafe situations — simply by shaking their device.

How It Works:
Once the device detects a shake gesture, the app automatically sends an emergency SMS notification containing the user’s real-time location (via GPS) to their pre-registered contacts. This ensures rapid response and assistance, even when the user is unable to make a call or manually send a message.

Key Features:

🚨 Emergency Trigger: Alerts guardians instantly through device shake detection.

📍 Location Sharing: Sends precise live GPS coordinates via SMS to emergency contacts.

📱 User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design built using XML layouts for smooth navigation.

⚙️ Reliable Background Service: Works even when the app is minimized or locked, ensuring constant protection.

🧭 Real-Time Safety: Ensures prompt communication during critical moments.
